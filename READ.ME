The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for purchasing luxury brand clothing for men and women, allowing customers to shop conveniently from home across the UK. The website is built using a three-tier architecture, with HTML as the presentation tier, Flask as the server for request handling, and SQLite as the data tier to store and manage customer data. Customers can log in, view product categories, add items to their shopping bag or wishlist, and proceed to checkout. Accessibility features include a high-contrast color scheme and a scroll-to-top button for easy navigation.
